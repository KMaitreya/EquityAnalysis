# EquityAnalysis
Web app that gives you a company's equity analysis.

THIS PROJECT IS A DEMO VERSION AND NOT THE FINAL PRODUCT

1) Create a .env file and add your OpenAI API key
2) Clone the repository
3) Run the file using the following command
```
streamlit run main.py
```

Currently only the 10k files published by apple and Netflix are added though you may see other companies in the drop-down.
